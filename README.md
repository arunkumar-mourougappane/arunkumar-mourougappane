# 💫 About Me

## Hi there 👋

I'm Arun (my friends call me A.K.), a hobbyist Embedded Developer, Astrophotographer, Nature Photographer, Household Electronics Maker, Gamer, and an eager enthusiast. I am passionate about converting ideas into embedded reality. I am always open to discussing innovative technology and challenging projects. To be short, I'm an Engineer who tries to dabble in analyzing, breaking down, and reverse-engineering Embedded Hardware for the sake of curiosity.

🏢 Where do I work?

- Currently, I work as a **Senior Embedded Software Engineer** for the Core Information Software Team at Caterpillar Inc. I enable secure telematics, Over-The-Air Updates (for all ECUs in the Machine Network), M2M, V2X, and Backoffice communications through Cellular Connections (LTE/4G/2G), Satellite Connections, WiFi, and over the wire using Ethernet.
- If you see an Excavator, Wheel Loader, Steam Roller, Heavy Truck, or Mini-Excavator, you might be seeing my work in action, protecting the machine from illegal access and securely handling telemetry and software.

🎓 Education

- **Master's degree, Electrical Engineering** - University at Buffalo (2013 - 2015)
- **Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.), Electrical and Electronics Engineering** - Pondicherry University (2008 - 2012)

🔭 I’m currently working on ...

- **[rover-esp32-control-server](https://github.com/arunkumar-mourougappane/rover-esp32-control-server)** & **[client](https://github.com/arunkumar-mourougappane/rover-esp32-control-client)**: A web-based rover controller setup.
- **[esp32-wifi-utility](https://github.com/arunkumar-mourougappane/esp32-wifi-utility)**: Production-ready WiFi analysis and management platform with real-time spectrum analysis.
- **[gjallarhorn-rs](https://github.com/arunkumar-mourougappane/gjallarhorn-rs)**: A Rust-based system resource monitoring application using Slint UI.
- **[rperf3-rs](https://github.com/arunkumar-mourougappane/rperf3-rs)**: A network throughput measurement tool written in Rust, inspired by iperf3.
- **[emby-assistant](https://github.com/arunkumar-mourougappane/emby-assistant)**: A desktop assistant UI to manage Emby server.
- **[mesh-sense](https://github.com/arunkumar-mourougappane/mesh-sense)**: An ESP32-based WiFi Mesh Sensor Network.
- **[ast-space-mobile-telemetry](https://github.com/arunkumar-mourougappane/ast-space-mobile-telemetry)**: Tracking AST Space Mobile satellites.
- Peering at the Universe, looking for the unknown.

🌱 I’m currently learning ...

- **Rust & Slint UI**: Developing efficient desktop applications.
- Low Level GFX to draw on LCD Panels optimally.
- Algorithms: It's been since 2015 that I started delving deep, and it's still ongoing!
- I have been recently interested in learning about satellite constellations and their orbits.
- Astrophotography and Astronomy: It's quite interesting to know even more about Earth's rotation relative to other planetary bodies.
- C++: It's bigger than you think and ever-growing.

🤔 I’m looking for help with ...

- Developing ESP32 firmware projects.
- Astronomy - I am a humble learner in this vast field.
- Hardware Testing for different projects or PCB realization.

💬 Ask me about ...

- Hardware interfacing questions.
- The best places to stargaze in Illinois or the North-East US.
- Solving concurrency issues in Embedded Systems.
- Shell scripting.- My photography collections and pictures.
- My satellite tracking projects.
