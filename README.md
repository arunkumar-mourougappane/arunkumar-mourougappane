### Hi there 👋

<img align="right" width="150" height="150" src="https://github.com/arunkumar-mourougappane/arunkumar-mourougappane/raw/master/profile.jpg" alt="Arun's Profile Picture" style="border-radius: 50%; object-fit: cover;">

I'm Arun (my friends call me A.K.), a hobbyist Embedded Developer, Astrophotographer, Nature Photographer, Household Electronics Maker, Gamer, and an eager enthusiast. I am passionate about converting ideas into embedded reality. I am always open to discussing innovative technology and challenging projects. To be short, I'm an Engineer who tries to dabble in analyzing, breaking down, and reverse-engineering Embedded Hardware for the sake of curiosity.

🏢 Where do I work?

- Currently, I work as a **Senior Embedded Software Engineer** for the Core Information Software Team at Caterpillar Inc. I enable secure telematics, Over-The-Air Updates (for all ECUs in the Machine Network), M2M, V2X, and Backoffice communications through Cellular Connections (LTE/4G/2G), Satellite Connections, WiFi, and over the wire using Ethernet.
- If you see an Excavator, Wheel Loader, Steam Roller, Heavy Truck, or Mini-Excavator, you might be seeing my work in action, protecting the machine from illegal access and securely handling telemetry and software.

🎓 Education

- **Master's degree, Electrical Engineering** - University at Buffalo (2013 - 2015)
- **Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.), Electrical and Electronics Engineering** - Pondicherry University (2008 - 2012)

🏆 Honors

- Caterpillar Inc. CEO Award for Excellence - 2024
- GPS Rollover Hero - 2019
- STAR OF LEARNER'S GROUP - 2013
- TCS GEMS - 2013
